# Calculator_App

A single ConstraintLayout as the root ViewGroup, which is the only layout in the design.
->  your app's main view shows
    • a numeric keyboard consisting of 10 buttons for the 10 digits
    • a clear button in the configuration shown below.
    • To the left of it, there should be a table listing for the bills and coins that make up the change for any
    entered amount.
    • In the top part of the screen, the entered amount is shown, next to a "Price:" label.
-> When you tap any digit button, the corresponding digit is added to your current amount
from the right
    • i.e., if you type the digits '2', '3', and '4' in this order, you first will see an amount of 0.02, then 0.23, and
    then 2.34.
    • On the left, you first will see 2 ‘1¢’, then 2 ‘10¢’ and 3 ‘1¢’, and finally 2 ‘1$’, 1 ‘25¢’, 1 ‘5¢’ and 4 ‘1¢’.
-> The clear button resets the price to zero.
